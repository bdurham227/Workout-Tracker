## Description
The TechBlog Application is built upon using Model View Controllers. The principal foundation of Models as database tables, Views as template that are rendered to the front-end, and lastly, Controllers as the backend logic that connects the backend to the frontend. In harmony, MVC applications create a fullstack application. This application aims to be a representation of that fullstack web development methodology. My process for building this app was first to create the database, models and pre-populate the database with some seed data. Next, I began to build out some simple create, read, update, destroy routes and tested them all in Insomnia before creating the Views templates to dyanmically render the data stored in the backend to the client on the frontend. I would love to rebuild this application again from scratch for more practice.
