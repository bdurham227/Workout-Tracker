## Description
The Fitness Tracker Application is a RESTful API built upon Express.Js and Mongoose that gives the user the feeling and control of a real Exercise tracking application. The app enables the user to add new workouts that they have completed to track the name ,types, weight, number of sets/reps, and duration of their workouts. This mini-project was a greate exercise in practicing and reiterating the principles of CRUD and following the Model View Controller methodology. Although, a template engine to dynamically render the front-end to the user was not used here, in future developments I would like to add Handlebars, Pug or even React to render out the front-end framework.
